My 41189 Reflective Portfolio 

Week 2

What have I learnt this week?
This week I have learnt about model thinking and what model thinking is. Models are used to help us visualise and understand information better as it is more organised. Models can help businesses and organisations make better decisions and create more effective strategies that can be used to better themselves. 
 
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know that models are not only there to display and help us visualise information, but it also allows us to store information and knowledge! Models help us organise our ideas and information which allows us to store it in a physical form rather than keeping it in our head and later on forgetting about it. 
 
What insights have I gained?
Insights that I have gained from this week include a quote from Mr. Ravindra. “Models are often described as simplifications of the world.” This helped me realise that this complex and vast world that we live in can be simplified into a physical and visual model that we can easily understand. Examples of this include DNA models, it is so small and complex as it makes up us individual humans. We can understand DNA and how we function and are made by analysing DNA models! Models help communicate ideas in a simple form so that everyone can understand it. 
 
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Upon reflection after this week's workshop I identified my strengths which is my eagerness to understand and learn more about models and how they are integrated into our lives. Weaknesses I have observed are that I am new to this subject unlike some other students. This has affected my confidence levels but I will try to overcome this and learn the material so that I can keep up with my classmates. 
 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
As stated above the challenges I encountered/observed was my understanding of this new subject and its unfamiliarity. I will handle this by putting more effort and time to understand this subject! 
 
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I now
 understand the flow of university after adapting, I will do research and try to learn more about the subject before my class so that I am able to follow along and understand what’s going on. 
 
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
A theory that proved to be useful to me is that “Models are often described as simplifications of the world”. This is useful to me as I found myself thinking that this subject and models are difficult but in reality it should be simple. I have learnt that models evoke us to think clearer, record our thoughts and ideas as well as use data to decide and strategise. 

Week 3

What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt about a range of models such as linear models, signalling, networks, growth: concavity and convexity models as well as so much more! We delved into modelling people and trying to understand organisations and understanding how emotions can play a huge role in terms of affecting models. 
 
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know about the rational, behavioural and rule-based models! 
 
What insights have I gained?
Insights I have gained are that we see rational behaviours when the stakes are high, when people make group decisions and choices are easy to make. We see that in behavioural models there are systematic errors in rational thinking. And lastly in rule-based models we can identify that people do things based on how like-minded individuals act around them. 
 
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My strength that I have identified is that I found myself relating to these models, as I myself, and everyone else, are human so naturally there is a connection and understanding in trying to model people and their behaviours. Weaknesses I found are trying to wrap my head around probability and axioms. 
 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I handled the challenge of not understanding the probability model by asking my fellow classmates for clarification. 
 
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I want to look back on my math notes and theory to better understand probability and its equations. I anticipate that this will help me in the future and better my problem solving skills.
 
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory on team diversity proved to be useful to me because everyone has different opinions and thought processes. I have learnt that by combining them and communicating as a team you can develop something incredible. I will definitely carry this theory with me onto my group projects. 

Week 4

What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt about system dynamics, networks and agent based models. System dynamics are used to model ecologies, economies, supply chains and production processes in businesses. I have learnt that system dynamics can help us improve our capacity to think logically. 
 
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know about positive and negative feedback and how it’s quite similar to infinity loops. So positive feedback is an increase in a variable and it produces an additional increase in that same variable. And negative feedback is the opposite. This is usually depicted in Causal Loop Diagrams! 
 
What insights have I gained?
Insights I have gained in terms of negative feedback are attained through examples such as when we are hungry our brain sends signals for us to eat, hence when we eat our brain receives signals from us from eating when we are full. 
 
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Strengths I have observed from this week is that I have had initial knowledge and understanding of positive and negative feedback loops, so this week's workshop has solidified my understanding of this theory. Networking was quite difficult for me to wrap my head around as a model could contain a large number of nodes and each node has a different or same connection to another node. It definitely causes confusion and is therefore identified as a weakness for me. 
 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
At first I was unfamiliar and overwhelmed with the structure of networks in its raw form. When Ravindra showed the deconstructed and individual structures of the networks i found it much easier to understand : the centralised, decentralised and distributed network structures. 
 
 
 
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Networking to me proved to be the most useful as it has helped me visualise how i can form connections with people who have connections with others and that it can link us all together. This will be important in the future when I join the workforce. 

Week 5

What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt about probability distributions as well as its regularity and extremes. I also learnt about linear models. 
 
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know how likely one can find the possible values and solutions from a random variable or equation. This is because a probability distribution model is a list of all the possible outcomes of a random variable. 
 
What insights have I gained?
Probability is used in many aspects of our lives such as weather forecasting, sports, insurance etc. Companies, especially life insurance companies use probability to estimate when their client dies to figure out if they will make a profit or not.
 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The Challenge that I had encountered before was that I had difficulty understanding probability but after today's lesson I feel much more confident about my understanding. 
 
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory of understanding the curves and skews of the curves can really help your understanding of information and trends. This can be further determined through identifying the mean, variance and standard deviation. 

Week 6

What have I learnt this week?
This week I have learned how complex systems evolve in time through path dependence, growth: concavity and convexity. 
 
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
A fun fact I learnt from today's lesson is that the keyboard “QWERTY” on our everyday computers is made like that because there was a path dependence to previous typewriters as this arrangement of keys caused less key jamming. 
 
What insights have I gained?
Insights I have gained is that we can measure and model countries against each other through their growth, economic growth, models and what enables growth to continue over time e.g. GDP. 
 
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
This week my team and I started assigning out work for our team proposal. My perceived strength is that I can write well and do good research but weaknesses that I have observed is that I am not as knowledgeable on theory.
 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenges my team and I encountered this week was balancing class theory and our assignment. To overcome this we decided to meet up and assign roles on what to do for our assignment. This made it easier for us to manage our time and work. 
 
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory that we need models that allow us to incorporate historic effects has helped me learn that as evolution continues so will our thought processes, values and models.
